You can open this repo on GitHub to read, use the GitHub Pages for a published version, or use an editor.
For example, it is easy to use `.` to start the GitHub Web Editor to read and edit these files.


## Build instructions
To create the HTML output, you can use:

```

This will create a `book` folder that contains the output for a static webpage like GitHub Pages.
